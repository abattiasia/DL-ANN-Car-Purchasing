This project focuses on developing a deep learning model using Sequential Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict car purchasing behavior. By leveraging a pre-trained model, we aim to improve prediction accuracy and significantly reduce training time. The ultimate goal is to accurately forecast car purchases based on a large dataset, highlighting the potential of deep learning in the automotive industry.
